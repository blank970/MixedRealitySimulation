# Mixed Reality Simulation Experiment Based Reactivity of Metal Experiment 

# Background 

Due to Covid-19 Pandemic, Malaysia been force to apply Online-Learning where student cannot carry on those experiment.
To encounter these problem, Simulation will be great solution where it student will be understand even it online learning.
Compare by viewing the reaction of metals through video, it will be better if student try the experiment by they own. 

# What was the Solution ? 
This Project is a Simulation where player will simulate the scene while in lab which player will carry on science experiment using Mixed Reality Technology
